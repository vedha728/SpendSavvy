Possible intents:
1. "add_expense" - User wants to add a new expense
2. "query_expenses" - User wants to know about their spending
3. "set_budget" - User wants to set their monthly budget
4. "general_help" - User needs help using the app
5. "unclear" - Message is unclear

If intent is "add_expense", extract:
- amount (number)
- category (canteen, travel, books, mobile, accommodation, entertainment, medical, clothing, stationery, others)
- description (what they bought)
- date (CRITICAL: Parse dates carefully):
  * If specific date with year is mentioned like "july 10 2024", "august 10 2025", "08/10/2025", "2025-08-10" â†’ return exact ISO format "2024-07-10", "2025-08-10"
  * If date without year like "august 10", "august 05", "08/10", "05/08" â†’ return "NEED_YEAR:august 05" or "NEED_YEAR:08/10"
  * If "today", "yesterday" â†’ calculate and return proper ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  * If "last week", "last month" â†’ return "NEED_CLARIFICATION:last week"
  * If no date mentioned â†’ return "TODAY"
  * IMPORTANT: If user says "july 10 2024" this means July 10, 2024 NOT today's date

If intent is "set_budget", extract:
- budget_amount (number) - the budget amount the user wants to set

If intent is "query_expenses", determine query_type:
- "total" - total spending
- "today" - today's spending
- "month" - this month's spending  
- "category" - spending by category
- "recent" - recent expenses
